**We are hiring PhD students and postdocs to start in 2024-25! If you're interested, please email me at sherwang \[at\] mit \[dot\] edu with your CV.**

I am PI of the [Earth Intelligence Lab](https://earthintelligence.mit.edu) at MIT, where our research uses novel data and computational algorithms to monitor our planet and enable sustainable development. 
Our focus is on improving agricultural management and mitigating climate change, especially in low- or middle-income regions of the world. 
To this end, we frequently use satellite imagery, crowdsourced data, LiDAR, and other spatial data. 
Due to the scarcity of ground truth data in these regions and the noisiness of real-world data in general, our methodological work is geared toward developing machine learning methods that work well with these constraints.

Prior to MIT, I was a Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley, hosted by [Solomon Hsiang](https://www.solomonhsiang.com) and the [Global Policy Lab](http://www.globalpolicy.science). In 2021, I obtained my PhD in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University, where I was advised by [David Lobell](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell) and benefited from mentors at the [Center on Food Security and the Environment](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu) and the [Sustainability and AI Lab](http://sustain.stanford.edu).
