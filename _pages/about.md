**Starting Spring 2023, I will be an Assistant Professor at MIT in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://meche.mit.edu) and [IDSS](https://idss.mit.edu). I am accepting new PhD students and postdocs for Fall 2023. If you're interested, please email me at sherwang \[at\] mit \[dot\] edu with your interests and CV!**

My research uses novel data and computational algorithms to monitor our planet and enable sustainable development. 
My focus is on improving agricultural management and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, especially in low- or middle-income regions of the world. 
To this end, I frequently use satellite imagery, crowdsourced data, LiDAR, and other spatial data. 
Due to the scarcity of ground truth data in these regions and the noisiness of real-world data in general, my methodological work is geared toward developing machine learning methods that work well with these constraints.

Currently, I am a Ciriacy-Wantrup Postdoctoral Fellow at UC Berkeley, hosted by [Solomon Hsiang](https://www.solomonhsiang.com) and the [Global Policy Lab](http://www.globalpolicy.science). In 2021, I obtained my PhD in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University, where I was advised by [David Lobell](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/people/david_lobell) and benefited from mentors at the [Center on Food Security and the Environment](https://fse.fsi.stanford.edu) and the [Sustainability and AI Lab](http://sustain.stanford.edu).
